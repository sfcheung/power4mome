This package is for power analysis and
sample size determination for
moderation, mediation, and moderated-mediation.

It includes functions for power
analysis and sample size determination for
moderation, mediation, and moderated-mediation
effects in models fitted by
structural equation modeling (SEM) or multiple
linear regression. For SEM, both latent variable
models and path models of observed variables
are supported.

For more information on this package,
please visit its GitHub page:

A get-started guide illustrates how to
use this package:

# Philosophy

The package was developed with this
philosophy:

- Easy to specify the population models,
  even with latent variables.

- As few manually-set numbers as possible
  when specifying the population models,
  with convenient default values.

- As few restrictions as possible
  on the form of the models, even when
  the models have latent factors.

- As automatic as possible in finding
  the sample size with the target power.

To achieve this comes with some costs,
and some of the goals conflict with other
goals: Being flexible usually means
being less user-friendly, and being
easy to specify the model usually means
not supporting some models.

Therefore, we also try to

- balance these goals, and

- allow the functions to be used in
  different ways, to accommodate
  scenarios that prioritize these goals
  differently.

# Installation

The latest developmental version of this package can be installed by `remotes::install_github`:

```r
remotes::install_github("sfcheung/power4mome")
```

# Background

Some of us the developers have developed the package
[`manymome`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/)
(Cheung & Cheung, 2024)
for computing and testing effects in
models with mediation, mediation,
or moderated-mediation. The tests are
usually done by simulation-based methods
such as Monte Carlo or bootstrap
confidence intervals, due to the complicated
sampling distributions of the effects.
Therefore, there are no simple ways to
determine the power of the test analytically
and accurately. The computation becomes
more complicated when latent variables
are involved, necessitating a simulation-based
method to estimate the sample size.

There are already many excellent packages
out there for estimating power in
structural equation modeling in general,
and some are also specifically for mediation
or moderated-mediation. We are not intended
to replace with them or reinvent the wheel.
We just want to have a tool that meet
our own needs:

(a) It leverages on the flexibility of `manymome`
in testing an indirect effect or
conditional effect with little limitations
on the model.

(b) It allows users (us and our collaborators) to
specify the population model as easy (quickly) as
typical power analysis programs.

We ourselves know how to do the power
estimation on our own by simulation,
if necessary. However, time is a concern
and we would like to
have an tool that, though specifically
designed with mediation, moderation,
and moderated-mediation in mind and may
be limited in scope (though it is a
"big" scope), is easy for our daily use
in estimating power.

So here it is, `power4mome`, developed
with we ourselves as the users, but we
believe are also useful for others who
need to do power analysis for mediation,
moderation, and moderated-mediation.

# Not Just That ...

But `power4mome` is not just for mediation,
moderation, and moderated-mediation. We
avoided hardcoding the functions just
for these effects, and have left room for
testing other effects, as hinted in some
examples in the help pages. They may be
introduced later. For now, supporting
effects that can be tested by `manymome`
is our priority.
