# Test Several Conditional Indirect Effects

Test several conditional indirect effects for a `power4test` object.

## Usage

``` r
test_cond_indirect_effects(
  fit = fit,
  x = NULL,
  m = NULL,
  y = NULL,
  wlevels = NULL,
  mc_ci = TRUE,
  mc_out = NULL,
  boot_ci = FALSE,
  boot_out = NULL,
  check_post_check = TRUE,
  test_method = c("ci", "pvalue"),
  ...,
  fit_name = "fit",
  get_map_names = FALSE,
  get_test_name = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- fit:

  The fit object, to be passed to
  [`manymome::cond_indirect_effects()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/reference/cond_indirect.html).

- x:

  The name of the `x`-variable, the predictor.

- m:

  A character vector of the name(s) of mediator(s). The path moves from
  the first mediator in the vector to the last mediator in the vector.
  Can be `NULL` and the path is a direct path without mediator.

- y:

  The name of the `y`-variable, the outcome variable.

- wlevels:

  The output of
  [`manymome::merge_mod_levels()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/reference/merge_mod_levels.html),
  or the moderator(s) to be passed to
  [`manymome::mod_levels_list()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/reference/mod_levels.html).
  If all the moderators can be represented by one variable, that is,
  each moderator is (a) a numeric variable, (b) a dichotomous
  categorical variable, or (c) a factor or string variable used in
  [`stats::lm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/lm.html) in fit, then it is a
  vector of the names of the moderators as appeared in the data frame.
  If at least one of the moderators is a categorical variable
  represented by more than one variable, such as user-created dummy
  variables used in
  [`lavaan::sem()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/lavaan/man/sem.html), then it
  must be a list of the names of the moderators, with such moderators
  represented by a vector of names. For example:
  `list("w1", c("gpgp2", "gpgp3")`, the first moderator `w1` and the
  second moderator a three-category variable represented by `gpgp2` and
  `gpgp3`. See the help page of
  [`manymome::cond_indirect_effects()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/reference/cond_indirect.html)
  for further details.

- mc_ci:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, the default, Monte Carlo confidence intervals will
  be formed. This argument and `boot_ci` cannot be both `TRUE`.

- mc_out:

  The pre-generated Monte Carlo estimates generated by
  [manymome::do_mc](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/reference/do_mc.html),
  stored in a `power4test` object. Users should not set this argument
  and should let
  [`power4test()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/power4mome/reference/power4test.md)
  to set it automatically.

- boot_ci:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, the default, nonparametric bootstrap confidence
  intervals will be formed. This argument and `mc_ci` cannot be both
  `TRUE`.

- boot_out:

  The pre-generated bootstrap estimates generated by
  [manymome::do_boot](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/reference/do_boot.html),
  stored in a `power4test` object. Users should not set this argument
  and should let
  [`power4test()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/power4mome/reference/power4test.md)
  to set it automatically.

- check_post_check:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, the default, and the model is fitted by `lavaan`,
  the test will be conducted only if the model passes the `post.check`
  conducted by
  [`lavaan::lavInspect()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/lavaan/man/lavInspect.html)
  (with `what = "post.check"`).

- test_method:

  The method to do the test. If `"ci"`, then the confidence interval
  (e.g., bootstrap confidence interval) will be used to do the test. If
  `"pvalue"`, then asymmetric *p*-value by Asparouhov & Muthén (2021)
  will be used to do the test, and the confidence interval will not be
  computed.

- ...:

  Additional arguments to be passed to
  [`manymome::cond_indirect_effects()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/reference/cond_indirect.html).

- fit_name:

  The name of the model fit object to be extracted. Default is `"fit"`.
  Used only when more than one model is fitted in each replication. This
  should be the name of the model on which the test is to be conducted.

- get_map_names:

  Logical. Used by
  [`power4test()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/power4mome/reference/power4test.md)
  to determine how to extract stored information and assign them to this
  function. Users should not use this argument.

- get_test_name:

  Logical. Used by
  [`power4test()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/power4mome/reference/power4test.md)
  to get the default name of this test. Users should not use this
  argument.

## Value

In its normal usage, it returns the output returned by
[`manymome::cond_indirect_effects()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/reference/cond_indirect.html),
with the following modifications:

- `est`: The estimated conditional indirect effects.

- `cilo` and `cihi`: The lower and upper limits of the confidence
  interval (95% by default), respectively.

- `sig`: Whether a test by confidence interval is significant (`1`) or
  not significant (`0`).

- `test_label`: A column of labels generated to label the conditional
  effects.

## Details

This function is to be used in
[`power4test()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/power4mome/reference/power4test.md)
for testing several conditional indirect effects, by setting it to the
`test_fun` argument.

It uses
[`manymome::cond_indirect_effects()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/reference/cond_indirect.html)
to do the test. It can be used on models fitted by
[`lavaan::sem()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/lavaan/man/sem.html) or fitted by
a sequence of calls to [`stats::lm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/lm.html),
although only nonparametric bootstrap confidence interval is supported
for models fitted by regression using
[`stats::lm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/lm.html).

It can also be used to test conditional effects on a direct path with no
mediator. Just omit `m` when calling the function.
