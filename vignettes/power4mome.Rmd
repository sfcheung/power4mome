# Introduction

This article is a brief illustration of how
to use `power4test()`
from the package
[power4mome](https://sfcheung.github.io/power4mome/)
to do power analysis of Mediation,
moderation, and moderated-mediation
in a model to be fitted by structural
equation model modeling using `lavaan`.

# Prerequisite

Basic knowledge about fitting models
by `lavaan` is required. Readers are
also expected to have basic knowledge
of mediation, moderation, and/or
moderated mediation.

# Scope

This is a brief illustration. More
complicated scenarios and other features
of `power4mome` will be described in
other vignettes.

# Package

This introduction only needs the following
package(s):


``` r
library(power4mome)
```

# Workflow

Two functions are sufficient for estimating
power give a particular model, population
values, sample size, and the test to be
used. This is the basic workflow:

1.  Specify the model syntax for the
    population model, in `lavaan`
    style, and set the population values of
    the model parameters.

3.  Call `power4test()` to examine the setup
    and the datasets generated. Repeat
    previous steps until the model is
    specified correctly.

4.  Call `power4test()` again, with the
    test to do specified.

5.  Call `get_rejection_rates()` to
    compute the power.

# Packages

Only the package `power4mome` is needed
in this vignette.


``` r
library(power4mome)
```

# Mediation

Let's consider a simple mediation
model. We would like to estimate the
power of testing a mediation effect
by Monte Carlo confidence interval.

## Specify the Population Model

This is the model syntax


``` r
mod <-
"
m ~ x
y ~ m + x
"
```

Note that, even if we are going to
test mediation, moderation, or
moderated-mediation effects, we do not
need to add any labels to this model.
This will be taken care of by the
test functions, through the use of
the package
[`manymome`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/index.html02224-z)
[@cheung_manymome_2024].


## Specify The Population Values {#es_convention}

There are two approaches to do this:
using named vectors or lists, or using
a long string similar to `lavaan`
model syntax. The second approach is
demonstrated below.

Suppose we want to estimate the power
when:

- The path from `x` to `m` are "large"
  in strength.

- The path from `m` to `y` are "medium"
  in strength.

- The path from `x` to `m` are "small"
  in strength.

By default, `power4mome` use this convention
for regression path and correlation:^[
Users can explicitly specify the values
if this convention is not suitable.]

- Small: .10 (or -.10)

- Medium: .30 (or -.30)

- Large: .50 (or -.50)

For product term, this is the convention:

- Small: .05 (or -.05)

- Medium: .10 (or -.10)

- Large: .15 (or -.15)

All these values are for the standardized
solution (the so-called "betas").

The following string denote the desired
values:


``` r
mod_es <-
"
m ~ x: l
y ~ m: m
y ~ x: s
"
```

Each line starts with a *tag*, which
is the parameter presented in `lavaan`
syntax. The tag ends with a colon, `:`.

After the colon is population value, which
can be:

- A word denoting the value. By default:

    - `s`: Small. (`-s` for small and negative.)

    - `m`: Medium. (`-m` for medium and negative.)

    - `l`: Large. (`-l` for large and negative.)

    - `nil`: Zero.

All regression coefficients and covariances,
if not specified, are set to zero.

## Call `power4test()` to Check the Model


``` r
out <- power4test(nrep = 2,
                  model = mod,
                  pop_es = mod_es,
                  n = 50000,
                  iseed = 1234)
```

These are the arguments used:

- `nrep`: The number of replications.
  In this stage, a small number can
  be used. It is more important to
  have a large sample size.

- `model`: The model syntax.

- `pop_es`: The string setting the
  population values.

- `n`: The sample size in each replications.
  In this stage, just for checking the
  model and the data generation, this
  number can be set to a large one unless
  the model is slow to fit when the
  sample size is large.

- `iseed`: If supplied, it is used to
  set the seed for the random number
  generator. It is advised to always set
  this to an arbitrary integer, to make
  the results reproducible.^[The functions
  used are `parallel::clusterSetRNGStream()`
  for parallel processing, and `set.seed()`
  for serial processing.]

The population values can be shown by
print this object:


``` r

By the default, the population model
will be fitted to each dataset, hence
the section `<fit>`.

The population values for the regression
paths are what we specified.

If necessary, we can check the data
generation by adding `data_long = TRUE`
when printing the output:

The section `Descriptive Statistics`, generated
by `psych::describe()`, shows basic
descriptive statistics for the observed
variables. As expected, they have means
close to zero and standard deviations
close to one, because the datasets were
generated using the standardized model.

The section `Parameter Estimates Based on`
shows the parameter estimates when the
population model is fitted to all the
datasets combined. When the total
sample size is large, these estimates
should be close to the population values.

The results show that population model
is the desired one.

## Call `power4test()` to Do the Target Test {#med_power}

We can now do the simulation to estimate
power. A large number of datasets (e.g., 500)
of the target sample size are to be generated,
and then the target test will be conducted
in each of these datasets.

Suppose we would like to estimate the
power of using Monte Carlo confidence interval
to test the indirect effect from `x` to
`y` through `m`, when sample size is 50.
This is the call:


``` r
out <- power4test(nrep = 100,
                  model = mod,
                  pop_es = mod_es,
                  n = 50,
                  R = 2000,
                  ci_type = "mc",
                  test_fun = test_indirect_effect,
                  test_args = list(x = "x",
                                   m = "m",
                                   y = "y",
                                   mc_ci = TRUE),
                  iseed = 1234,
                  parallel = TRUE)
```

These are the new arguments used:

- `R`: The number of replications used
  to generate the Monte Carlo simulated
  estimates, 2000 in this example.

- `ci_type`: The method used to
  generate estimates. Support Monte
  Carlo (`"mc"`) and nonparametric
  bootstrapping (`"boot"`).^[They
  are implemented by `manymome::do_mc()`
  and `manymome::do_boot()`, respectively.]
  Although bootstrapping is usually used
  to test an indirect effect, it is very
  slow to do `R` bootstrapping in `nrep`
  datasets (the model will be fitted
  `R*nrep` times). Therefore, it is
  preferable to use Monte Carlo to do
  the initial estimation.

- `test_fun`: The function to be used
  to do the test for each replication.
  Any function following a specific
  requirement can be used, and
  `power4mome` comes with several
  built-in function for some tests.
  The function `test_indirect_effect()`
  is used to test an indirect effect
  in the model.

- `test_args`: A named list of arguments
  to be supplied to `test_fun`.
  For `test_indirect_effect()`, it is
  a named list specifying the predictor
  (`x`), the mediator(s) (`m`), and
  the outcome (`y`). A path with any
  number of mediators can be supported.
  Please refer to the help page of
  `test_indirect_effect()`.^[The test
  is implemented by `manymome::indirect()`.]

- `parallel`: If the test to be conducted
  is slow, which is the case for
  test done by Monte Carlo or nonparametric
  bootstrapping confidence interval,
  it is advised to enable parallel
  processing by setting `parallel` to
  `TRUE`.^[The number of cores is determined
  automatically but can be set directly
  by the `ncores` argument.]

## Compute the Power

The power estimate is simply the proportion
of significant results, the *rejection*
*rate*, because the
null hypothesis is false. The rejection
rate can be retrieved by
`get_rejection_rates()`.


``` r
out_power <- get_rejection_rates(out)
```

The output is simply a data frame:


``` r
out_power
#>                     test test_label pvalid reject
#> 1 test_indirect: x->m->y       Test      1   0.43
```



In the example above, the estimated
power of the test of the indirect
effect, conducted by Monte Carlo
confidence interval, is
0.430.^[`pvalid` is
the proportion of valid results
across replications. `1` means that
the test conducted normally in all
replications.]


# Moderation

Let's consider a moderation model,
with some control variables.

## Specify the Population Model and Values {#pop_es_xw}


``` r
mod <-
"
y ~ x + w + x:w + control
"
```

This model has only moderation, with
the predictor `x` and the moderator
`w`. The product term is included in
the `lavaan` style, `x:w`.

It is
unrealistic to specific the population
values for all control variables. Therefore,
we can just add a proxy, `control`
to represent the set of control variables
that may be included.

This is the syntax for the population
values:


``` r
mod_es <-
"
.beta.: s
x ~~ control: s
y ~ control: m
y ~ x:w: m
"
```

This example introduce one useful
tag, `.beta.` For a model with many
paths, it is inconvenient to specify
all of them manually. The tag `.beta`
specify the default value for all
regression path, which is small (.10)
in this example. If a path is explicitly
included (such as `y ~ control` and
`y ~ x:w`), the values will override
that of `.beta.`.

This example also illustrates that we
can set the population values for
correlation (covariance in the
standardized solution). Control variables
are included usually because they may
correlate with the predictors. Therefore,
in this example, it is hypothesized
that there is a small correlation between
`x` and the control variable (`x ~~ control: s`).

Last, recall from [this section](#es_convention)
that the convention for product term
values are different: `s` denotes
.05 for product terms.

## Call `power4test()` to Check the Model

We check the model first:


``` r
out <- power4test(nrep = 2,
                  model = mod,
                  pop_es = mod_es,
                  n = 50000,
                  iseed = 1234)
```


``` r
print(out,
      data_long = TRUE)

The population values for the regression
paths are what we specified, and the
estimates based on 5 &times; 10<sup>4</sup>
by 2 or
100000
support that the dataset were generated
correctly.

## Call `power4test()` to Test The Moderation Effect

We can now do the simulation to estimate
power. In this simple model, the test
is just a test of the product term,
`x:w`. This model can be fitted by
linear regression using `lm()`. Let's
estimate the power when the sample size
is 50 and the model is fitted by `lm()`:


``` r
out <- power4test(nrep = 500,
                  model = mod,
                  pop_es = mod_es,
                  n = 50,
                  fit_model_args = list(fit_function = "lm"),
                  test_fun = test_moderation,
                  iseed = 1234,
                  parallel = TRUE)
```

These are the new arguments used:

- `fit_model_args`: This named list
  is arguments for `fit_model()`.
  By default, `lavaan::sem()` is used.
  To fit the model by linear regression
  using `lm()`, add `fit_function = "lm"`
  to the list.^[See the help page of
  `fit_model()` on other available
  arguments.]

- `test_fun`: It is set to
  `test_moderation` in this example.
  This function automatically identify
  all product terms in a model and
  test them. The test used depends
  on method used to fit the model.
  If `lm()` is used, then the usual
  *t* test is used.^[The test name
  has `CIs` in it but this is
  equivalent to using the *t* test
  when the model is fitted by `lm()`.]

## Compute the Power

We can ues `get_rejection_rates()`
again to estimate the power:


``` r
out_power <- get_rejection_rates(out)
out_power
#>                    test test_label pvalid reject
#> 1 test_moderation: CIs       y~x:w      1  0.118
```



The estimated
power of the test of the product term,
`x:w`, is
0.118.

The function `power4test()` also supports
redoing an analysis using a new value
for the sample size. Simply set the
output of `power4test` as the first
argument, and set the new value for
`n`:


``` r
out_new_n <- power4test(out,
                        n = 200)
out_new_n
```



This is the estimated power when
the sample size is 200.


``` r
out_new_n_reject <- get_rejection_rates(out_new_n)
out_new_n_reject
#>                    test test_label pvalid reject
#> 1 test_moderation: CIs       y~x:w      1  0.296
```



The estimated power is 0.296
when the sample size is
200. This process can be
repeated to find the required sample
size for a target power. (The function
`power4test_by_n()` can be used To
estimate the power for a sequence of
sample sizes.)

# Moderated-Mediation

Let's consider a moderated mediation
model.

## Specify the Population Model and Values


``` r
mod <-
"
m ~ x + w + x:w
y ~ m + x
"
```

This model is a mediation model with
the *a*-path, `m ~ x`, moderated by
`w`. As explained before, there is
no need to use any label nor define
and parameters. This will be handled
by the test function to be used.

This is the syntax for the population
values:


``` r
mod_es <-
"
.beta.: s
m ~ x: m
y ~ m: m
m ~ x:w: s
"
```

Please refer to [the previous section](#pop_es_xw)
on setting up this syntax.

## Call `power4test()` to Check the Model

We check the model first:


``` r
out <- power4test(nrep = 2,
                  model = mod,
                  pop_es = mod_es,
                  n = 50000,
                  iseed = 1234)
```


``` r

The population values and the
estimates based on 5 &times; 10<sup>4</sup>
by 2 or
100000
are what we expect.

## Call `power4test()` to Test The Moderated-Mediation Effect

To estimate the power of a
moderated-mediation effect, we can
test the *index of moderated-mediation*
[@hayes_index_2015]. In this example,
it is the product of the coefficient
`m ~ x:w` and the coefficient `y ~ m`.
This can be done by the test function
`test_index_of_mome()`. Again, Monte
Carlo confidence interval is used.

Let's estimate
the power when sample size is 100.


``` r
out <- power4test(nrep = 500,
                  model = mod,
                  pop_es = mod_es,
                  n = 100,
                  R = 2000,
                  ci_type = "mc",
                  test_fun = test_index_of_mome,
                  test_args = list(x = "x",
                                   m = "m",
                                   y = "y",
                                   w = "w",
                                   mc_ci = TRUE),
                  iseed = 1234,
                  parallel = TRUE)
```

The call is similar to the one used in
[testing mediation](#med_power).
These are the new arguments used:

- `test_fun`: It is set to
  `test_index_of_mome()` in this example.
  This function is similar to
  `test_indirect_effect()`, with one
  more argument, `w`, for the moderator.
  Although this example has only one mediator,
  it support any number of mediators
  along a path.^[The test is implemented
  by `manymome::test_index_of_mome().]

## Compute the Power

We can ues `get_rejection_rates()`
again to estimate the power:


``` r
out_power <- get_rejection_rates(out)
out_power
#>                                          test test_label pvalid reject
#> 1 test_index_of_mome: x->m->y, moderated by w       Test      1  0.056
```



The estimated
power of the test of moderated mediation
effect, conducted by a test of the
index of moderated mediation, is
0.056.

As shown above, we can rerun the analysis
using a larger sample size:


``` r
out_new_n <- power4test(out,
                        n = 500)
```



This is the estimated power when
the sample size is 500.


``` r
out_new_n_reject <- get_rejection_rates(out_new_n)
out_new_n_reject
#>                                          test test_label pvalid reject
#> 1 test_index_of_mome: x->m->y, moderated by w       Test      1   0.21
```



The estimated power is 0.210
when the sample size is
500. This process can be
repeated to find the required sample
size for a target power.

Unlike the previous example on moderation
tested by regression, estimating the power
of Monte Carlo confidence intervals is
substantially slower. However, we believe
this is necessary because Monte Carlo
or nonparametric bootstrapping
confidence interval is the test usually
used in moderated-mediation (and mediation).

# Advanced Features

This brief illustration only cover
basic features of `power4mome`. These
are other advanced features to be
covered in other articles:

- There is no inherent restriction on the
  form of the model. Typical models that
  can be specified in `lavaan` model
  syntax can be the population model,
  although there may be special models
  in which `power4test` does not support.

- The population model can be a model
  with latent factors and indicators.
  Nevertheless, users can specify only
  the relation among the factors.
  There is no need to include indicators
  in the model syntax, and also no need
  to manually specify the factor loadings.
  The number of indicators for each
  factor and the factor loadings are
  set by the argument `number_of_indicators`
  and `reliability` (see the help page
  of `sim_data()` on how to set them).
  The model syntax used to fit to the
  data will automatically include the
  indicators.

- Though not illustrated above,
  estimating the power of tests
  conducted by nonparametric
  bootstrapping is supported, although
  it will take some time to run.

- Although this package focuses on
  moderation, mediation, and
  moderated-mediation, in principle,
  the power of any test can be estimated,
  as long as a test function for
  `test_fun` is available. Some other
  functions are provided with `power4mome`
  (e.g., `test_parameters()` for testing
  all free model parameters). See the
  help page of `do_test()` on how to
  write a function to do a test not
  available in `power4mome`.

- When estimating power, usually the
  population model is fitted to the
  data. However, it is possible to
  fit any other model to the generated
  data. This can be done by using
  the argument `fit_model_args` to
  set the argument `model` of
  `fit_model()`.

- Preliminary support for
  multigroup model is available.
  See the help pages of `ptable_pop()`
  and `pop_es_yaml()` on how to
  specify the population value syntax.
  Functions will be added for tests
  relevant to multigroup models (e.g.,
  testing the between-group difference
  in an indirect effect).

- Although we illustrated only rerunning
  an analysis with a new sample size (`n`),
  it is also possible to rerun an analysis
  using a new population value for a
  parameter. This can be done by using
  the previous output of `power4test()`
  as the first argument, and setting
  only `pop_es` to a named vector:

```r
out_new_xw <- power4test(out,
                         pop_es = c("m ~ x:w" = ".30"))
```

- Instead of manually rerunning the
  analyais, it is possible to rerun the
  analysis over a sequence of sample sizes
  or population values. See the help
  pages of `power4test_by_n()` and
  `power4test_by_pop_es()` for details.

- Basic support for generating
  nonnormal variables, including
  dichotomous variables. See the
  argument `x_fun` of `power4test()`
  for details.


# Limitations

- Monte Carlo confidence interval is
  not supported for models fitted by
  `lm()` (regression). To estimate
  power of testing mediation or
  moderated-mediation effects,
  `ci_type = "boot"` is needed.
