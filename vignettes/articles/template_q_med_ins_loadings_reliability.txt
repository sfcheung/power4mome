# Setting the Factor Loadings

One difficulty in doing power analysis
for latent variable model is setting
the population values for the indicators.

In [`power4mome`](https://sfcheung.github.io/power4mome/), instead of setting
factor loadings and error variances,
users can specify the number of indicators
and the population reliability of each
latent factor. The corresponding factor
loadings and error variances will be
computed and specified automatically.

Therefore, when doing the power analysis,
users can just specify the number of
indicators (items) for each factor, which
is usually known exactly or approximately
in advance. The hypothesized population
reliability coefficient may be
based on previous studies or set to to
a reasonable expectation (e.g., .70 for
minimal acceptable reliability).
