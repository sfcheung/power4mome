
# Find the Regions of *N* Based on the Target Power

Search, by simulation, the following
two regions of sample sizes:

- Sample sizes with estimated levels of
  power significantly below the target
  level (e.g., .80), tested by the
  confidence interval (95% by default).

- Sample sizes with estimated levels of
  power significantly above the target
  level (e.g., .80), tested by the
  confidence interval (95% by default).

In practice, we rarely need high precision
for these regions for sample size planning.
Therefore, we only need to find the two
sample sizes with the corresponding
confidence bounds *close* *enough* to
the target power, defined by a tolerance value.
In the function below, this value is .02
by default.

It can take some time to run if the estimated power
of the sample size is too different from
the target power.

We can find the two regions by `n_region_from_power()`.

The code:

```{r med_n_simple_n_from, eval=TRUE, results="hide", message=FALSE, fig.keep="none"}
#
# ===== Reuse the output of power4test() =====
#
# Call n_region_from_power()
# - Set target power: target_power = .80 (Default, can be omitted)
# - Set the seed for the simulation: Integer. Should always be set.
# To set desired precision:
# - Set final number of R: final_R = 1000 (Default, can be omitted)
# - Set final number of replications: final_nrep = 400 (Default, can be omitted)

n_power_region <- n_region_from_power(out,
                                      seed = 1357)
