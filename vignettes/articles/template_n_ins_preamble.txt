# Introduction

This and other "Quick Template" articles
are examples of R code to determine the
range of sample sizes for a target level of power in
typical models using
[power4mome](https://sfcheung.github.io/power4mome/).
Users can quickly adapt
them for their scenarios. A summary
of the code examples can be found
in the section [Code Template](#code_template)
at the end of this document.

# Prerequisite

Basic knowledge about fitting models
by `lavaan` and `power4mome` is required.

This file is not intended to be an introduction
on how to use functions in `power4mome`.
For details on how to use `power4test()`,
refer to the [Get-Started article](https://sfcheung.github.io/power4mome/articles/power4mome.html).
Please also refer to the help page
of `n_region_from_power()`, and the
[article](https://sfcheung.github.io/power4mome/articles/x_from_power_for_n.html)
on `n_from_power()`, which is called
twice by `n_region_from_power()` to
find the regions described below.
