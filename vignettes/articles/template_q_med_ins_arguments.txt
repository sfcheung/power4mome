
- `target_power`: The target level of
  power. Default is .80, and can be
  omitted if this is the desired level
  of power

- `nrep`: The number of replications
  when estimating the power for a
  sample size. Default is 400.
  Can be omitted if this is the desired
  number of replications.

- `R`: The number of random samples used
  in forming Monte Carlo or nonparametric
  bootstrapping confidence intervals.
  Although they should be large when
  testing an effect in one single sample,
  they can be smaller because the goal
  is to estimate power across replications,
  not to achieve high accuracy in each
  sample. Default is 1000. Can be omitted
  if the default is acceptable.

- `seed`: The seed for the random number
  generator. Note that, if parallel
  processing is used (this is the default),
  then the results are reproducible
  *only* if the configuration is exactly
  identical. Moreover, changes in the
  algorithm will also make results
  not reproducible even with the same
  seed. Nevertheless, it is still advised
  to set this seed to an integer, to
  make the results reproducible at least
  on the same machine.
