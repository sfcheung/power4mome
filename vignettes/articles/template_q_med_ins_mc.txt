## Test to be Used

In practice, nonparametric
bootstrapping is usually used to
test indirect effects. However,
estimating its power using simulation
is slow. A good-enough proxy is to
estimate the power when testing this
effect by Monte Carlo confidence interval.
This is the default method in [`power4mome`](https://sfcheung.github.io/power4mome/)
for tests of indirect effects.
