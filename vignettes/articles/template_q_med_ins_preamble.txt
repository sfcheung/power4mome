# Introduction

This and other "Quick Function" articles
are examples of R code to determine the
range of sample sizes for a target level of power
or estimate the power for a specific
scenario in
typical mediation models using
[`power4mome`](https://sfcheung.github.io/power4mome/).
Users can quickly adapt
them for their scenarios. They are
how-to guides and will not cover the
technical details involved.

# Prerequisite

These functions are wrappers to
`power4test()` and `n_region_from_power()`.
For simple scenarios, users do not need
to know how to use these advanced functions,
though knowledge about them can help
customizing the search for the region.
Further information on these functions
can be found in [Final Remarks](#final_remarks)
