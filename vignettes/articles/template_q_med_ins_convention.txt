## Convention for the Effect Sizes {#convention}

To make it easy to specify the standardized
population values of parameters,
[`power4mome`](https://sfcheung.github.io/power4mome/)]
adopted the convention for
Pearson's *r*, just for convenience.

- `"nil"`: Nil (.00).

- `"s"`: Small (.10).

- `"m"`: Medium (.30),

- `"l"`: Large (.50).

There are also two intermediate levels:

- `"sm"`: Small-to-medium (.20).

- `"ml"`: Medium-to-large (.40).

If the effect is negative, just add
a minus sign. For example, use
`"-m"` to denote a negative medium effect.

For a path from one variable to another
variable, the standardized coefficient
is equal to the correlation if there are
not other predictor, or if this predictor
is uncorrelated with all other predictors.
Therefore, though may not be perfect,
we believe the convention of Pearson's *r*
is a reasonable one.

If necessary, users can specify the
effect (on the standardized metric)
directly.
