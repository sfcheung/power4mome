# Introduction

This and other "Quick Function" articles
are examples of R code to determine the
range of sample sizes for a target level of power
or estimate the power for a specific
scenario in
typical mediation models using
[`power4mome`](https://sfcheung.github.io/power4mome/).
Users can quickly adapt
them for their scenarios. They are
how-to guides and will not cover the
technical details involved.

# Prerequisite

These functions are wrappers to
`power4test()` and `n_region_from_power()`.
For simple scenarios, users do not need
to know how to use these advanced functions,
though knowledge about them can help
customizing the search for the region.
Further information on these functions
can be found in [Final Remarks](#final_remarks)

# Scope

This file is for parallel mediation models,
and only use one function `q_power_mediation_parallel()`
from the package
[power4mome](https://sfcheung.github.io/power4mome/).


``` r
library(power4mome)
```

# The Model

Suppose this is the model:

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="template_q_med_obs_parallel_model-1.png" alt="The Model"  />
<p class="caption">The Model</p>
</div>

We want to do power analysis for the
indirect effects from `x` to `y`:
`x->m1->y`, `x->m2->y`, and `x->m2->y`.
Suppose these are the expected
effects:

- `x->m1`: small

- `x->m2`: medium

- `x->m3`: medium

- `m1->y`: large

- `m2->y`: medium

- `m3->y`: large

- `x->y`: nil (no effect)

In `power4mome`, the convention for
Pearson's *r* is used just for convenience.
If necessary, users can specify the
effect (on the standardized metric)
directly.


## Convention for the Effect Sizes {#convention}

To make it easy to specify the standardized
population values of parameters,
[`power4mome`](https://sfcheung.github.io/power4mome/)
adopted the convention for
Pearson's *r*, just for convenience.

- `"nil"`: Nil (.00).

- `"s"`: Small (.10).

- `"m"`: Medium (.30),

- `"l"`: Large (.50).

There are also two intermediate levels:

- `"sm"`: Small-to-medium (.20).

- `"ml"`: Medium-to-large (.40).

If the effect is negative, just add
a minus sign. For example, use
`"-m"` to denote a negative medium effect.

For a path from one variable to another
variable, the standardized coefficient
is equal to the correlation if there are
not other predictor, or if this predictor
is uncorrelated with all other predictors.
Therefore, though may not be perfect,
we believe the convention of Pearson's *r*
is a reasonable one.

If necessary, users can specify the
effect (on the standardized metric)
directly.


## Covariates in the Model to be Fitted

In applied research, the model to be fitted
usually have other control variables,
such as educational level. It may not
be practical to specify all the probable
effects of these control variables (though
it is possible in [`power4mome`](https://sfcheung.github.io/power4mome/)).

Therefore, as a conservative assessment
of power, users can first decide the
population effects, and then adjust them
slightly downward (e.g., from medium, `"m"`,
to small-to-medium, `"sm"`) to take into
account potential decrease in effects
due to control variables to be included.


## Model with Hypothesized Path Coefficients

This is the model with the effect sizes:

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="template_q_med_obs_parallel_model_es-1.png" alt="The Model (with Effect Sizes)"  />
<p class="caption">The Model (with Effect Sizes)</p>
</div>

## Omnibus Power for All Indirect Paths

There are more than one indirect path,
so there are more than one tests.
The function in `power4mome`
supports finding the power for detecting
*all* the indirect paths, that is, the
probability that all the *tests* of
indirect effects are
significant. We call this power the
*omnibus* power for the indirect paths.


## Test to be Used

In practice, nonparametric
bootstrapping is usually used to
test indirect effects. However,
estimating its power using simulation
is slow. A good-enough proxy is to
estimate the power when testing this
effect by Monte Carlo confidence interval.
This is the default method in [`power4mome`](https://sfcheung.github.io/power4mome/)
for tests of indirect effects.


# Find the Power

To estimate the power for a sample size,
this is the code:


``` r
out_power <- q_power_mediation_parallel(
  as = c("s", "m", "m"),
  bs = c("l", "m", "l"),
  cp = "nil",
  target_power = .80,
  nrep = 400,
  n = 300,
  R = 1000,
  seed = 1234
)
```

These are the arguments:

- `as`: The hypothesized standardized effects
  from the predictor `x`
  to each mediator. This
  should be a character vector with elements
  equal to the number of mediators
  for the path coefficients `x->m1`, `x->m2`,
  up to `x->mk`, `k` being the number of mediators.
  Can be one of the labels supported
  by the [convention](#convention), or
  a numeric value.

- `bs`: The hypothesized standardized effects
  from each mediator to the outcome variable `y`.
  This
  should be a character vector with elements
  equal to the number of mediators
  for the path coefficients `m1->y`, `m2->y`,
  up to `mk->y`, `k` being the number of mediators.
  Can be one of the labels supported
  by the [convention](#convention), or
  a numeric value.

- `cp`: The hypothesized standardized direct
  effect from
  the predictor `x` to the outcome variable `y`.
  Can be one of the labels supported
  by the [convention](#convention), or
  a numeric value.




- `target_power`: The target level of
  power. Default is .80, and can be
  omitted if this is the desired level
  of power

- `nrep`: The number of replications
  when estimating the power for a
  sample size. Default is 400.
  Can be omitted if this is the desired
  number of replications.

- `R`: The number of random samples used
  in forming Monte Carlo or nonparametric
  bootstrapping confidence intervals.
  Although they should be large when
  testing an effect in one single sample,
  they can be smaller because the goal
  is to estimate power across replications,
  not to achieve high accuracy in each
  sample. Default is 1000. Can be omitted
  if the default is acceptable.

- `seed`: The seed for the random number
  generator. Note that, if parallel
  processing is used (this is the default),
  then the results are reproducible
  *only* if the configuration is exactly
  identical. Moreover, changes in the
  algorithm will also make results
  not reproducible even with the same
  seed. Nevertheless, it is still advised
  to set this seed to an integer, to
  make the results reproducible at least
  on the same machine.


This is the output:

The first set of output is the default printout
of the output of `power4test()`. This
can be used to check the model specified.
It also automatically computes the
population standardized indirect effect(s).

The second section is the output of
`rejection_rates()`, showing the power
under the column `reject`.

In this example, the power is about
0.40 for
sample size 300.



# Find the Region of Sample Sizes

In addition to estimate the power for
a sample size, the function can also
be used to find an approximate region
of sample sizes with levels of power
*not* significantly different from the
target power. This region is useful
for determining a range of sample sizes
likely to have sufficient power, but
are not greater than necessary when
resources are limited.

Note that this process can be slow.
Nevertheless, power analysis is usually
conducted in the planning stage of a
study, and so the slow processing time is
acceptable in this stage.

Finding the region can be done using the
same code
above, with the argument `mode = "region"`
added:




``` r
out_region <- q_power_mediation_parallel(
  as = c("s", "m", "m"),
  bs = c("l", "m", "l"),
  cp = "nil",
  target_power = .80,
  nrep = 400,
  n = 300,
  R = 1000,
  seed = 1234,
  mode = "region"
)
```





This is the printout, showing only the
section from the output of `n_region_from_power()`:


```
#> ========== n_region_from_power Results ==========
#> 
#> Call:
#> n_region_from_power(object = `<hidden>`, target_power = 0.8, 
#>     progress = TRUE, simulation_progress = TRUE, max_trials = 10, 
#>     seed = 1234)
#> 
#>                      Setting                                      
#> Predictor(x)         Sample Size                                  
#> Goal:                Power significantly below or above the target
#> algorithm:           bisection                                    
#> Level of confidence: 95.00%                                       
#> Target Power:        0.800                                        
#> 
#> Solution: 
#> 
#> Approximate region of sample sizes with power:
#> - not significantly different from 0.800: 728 to 947
#> - significantly lower than 0.800: 728
#> - significantly higher than 0.800: 947
#> 
#> Confidence intervals of the estimated power:
#> - for the lower bound (728): [0.734, 0.816]
#> - for the upper bound (947): [0.817, 0.886]
#> 
#> Call `summary()` for detailed results.
```

In this example, the range of the sample
size is 728 to 947.

The results can also be visualized using
the `plot()` function:


<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="template_q_med_obs_parallel_model_region-1.png" alt="The Plot of Sample Sizes Searched"  />
<p class="caption">The Plot of Sample Sizes Searched</p>
</div>

The region between the shaded areas is the
approximate region of sample sizes found.
