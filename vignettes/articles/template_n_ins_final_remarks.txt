# Final Remarks

For a moderate to small `nrep`, the
results may be
sensitive to the `seed`. It is
advised to do a final check of the
sample size to be used using
`power4test()` and an `nrep` of 1000
or 2000.

For other options of `power4test()`
and `n_region_from_power()`, please refer to
their help pages, as well as the
[Get-Started article](power4mome.html)
and this [article](x_from_power_for_n.html)
for `n_from_power()`, which is the
function to find one of the regions,
called twice by `n_region_from_power()`.
