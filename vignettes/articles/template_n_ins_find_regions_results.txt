
As shown above, approximately:

- sample sizes lower than
  `r n_power_region$below$x_final` have
  power significantly lower than .80, and

- sample sizes higher than
  `r n_power_region$above$x_final` have
  power significantly higher than .80.

In other words, sample sizes between
`r n_power_region$below$x_final` and
`r n_power_region$above$x_final` have
power not significantly different from
.80.

If necessary, detailed results can be
printed by `summary()`:

```{r summary}
# ===== Detailed Results =====
summary(n_power_region)
