## Covariates in the Model to be Fitted

In applied research, the model to be fitted
usually have other control variables,
such as educational level. It may not
be practical to specify all the probable
effects of these control variables (though
it is possible in [`power4mome`](https://sfcheung.github.io/power4mome/)).

Therefore, as a conservative assessment
of power, users can first decide the
population effects, and then adjust them
slightly downward (e.g., from medium, `"m"`,
to small-to-medium, `"sm"`) to take into
account potential decrease in effects
due to control variables to be included.
