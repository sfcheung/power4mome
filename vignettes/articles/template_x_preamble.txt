# Introduction

This and other "Quick Template" vignettes
are examples of R code to do power
analysis or determine sample size in
typical models using
[power4mome](https://sfcheung.github.io/power4mome/).
Users can quickly adapt
them for their scenarios.

# Prerequisite

Basic knowledge about fitting models
by `lavaan` and `power4mome` is required.

This file is not intended to be an introduction
on how to use functions in `power4mome`.
For details on how to use `power4test()`,
`power4test_by_n()`, and `n_from_power()`,
refer to the [Get-Started article](https://sfcheung.github.io/power4mome/articles/power4mome.html),
and the [article](https://sfcheung.github.io/power4mome/articles/x_from_power_for_n.html)
on finding the sample size
given desired power using `n_from_power()`,
as well as the help pages of these
functions.
