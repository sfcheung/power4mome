
# Find the Region of Sample Sizes

In addition to estimate the power for
a sample size, the function can also
be used to find an approximate region
of sample sizes with levels of power
*not* significantly different from the
target power. This region is useful
for determining a range of sample sizes
likely to have sufficient power, but
are not greater than necessary when
resources are limited.

Note that this process can be slow.
Nevertheless, power analysis is usually
conducted in the planning stage of a
study, and so the slow processing time is
acceptable in this stage.

Finding the region can be done using the
same code
above, with the argument `mode = "region"`
added:
