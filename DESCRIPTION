Description: Power analysis and sample size determination
  for moderation, mediation, and moderated mediation in models
  fitted by structural equation modelling using the 'lavaan'
  package by Rosseel (2012) <doi:10.18637/jss.v048.i02> or
  by multiple regression. The package 'manymome' by
  Cheung and Cheung (2024) <doi:10.3758/s13428-023-02224-z>
  is used to specify the indirect paths or conditional
  indirect paths to be tested.
